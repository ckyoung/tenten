# Tenten Co. Frontend Challenge

This project is only made to prove my **skills** and **workflow** in front-end web development.
It is not a real open source project. And the assets that I've used in this project are not mine.


#### My DevDependcies:
*  **Browser Sync** - For web browser live refresh development
*  **VueJS** - For simple javascript UI interaction
*  **Animate CSS** - My choice of CSS animation library
*  **WOWjs** - Reveal Animations When You Scroll. Very [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/ "Animate.css") Friend
*  **Babel JS** - For older browser JS compatibility
*  **Pug Templating** - The HTML templating of my choice
*  **SASS** - Professional grade CSS extension language
*  **GulpJS** - The simple task runner
*  **Gulp Zip** - To command to zip my source code
*  **PostCSS** - A tool for transforming CSS with JS plugins

	* Autoprefixier - CSS prefix for other browser

	* CSSNano - Minified the CSS faster

  
  

#### Basic Usage:

* Installation - `$ npm install`
* Boot up local development server - `$ npm start`
* If Gulp install globally - `$ gulp serve`

## My Workflow

1. **Making a Folder & File Structure**
	- First, I make a folder & file structure, so the development will be easy and maintainable.
 
2. **Installing and Configuring Development Environment**
	- I install all necessary Gulp task packages such as Babel, Pug, Sass etc...
	 And after that I configure Gulp browsers-sync for real time browser development.

3. **Developing using Pug and SASS**
	- I use Pug and SASS for better html and CSS management. And to help maintain code easily.

4. **Mobile First Design**
	- I create layout using mobile first approach for layout responsiveness.

5. **Using Vuejs for UI Interaction**
	- I use Vuejs to make UI interaction more simple and easily extensible.
	
6. **Animating using Wow and AnimateCSS**
	- Wow and AnimateCSS simplify my UI animation and at the same it can easily use for my future purpose.
	
7. **Committing in Git with understandable message**
	- I commit my files to Git with understandable message so I can easily maintain my source code.

### Note
	I believe this source code can still be improve by team effort 
	or by refactoring.
